## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I did half of this challenge, then was super busy and ended up coming back to it after several months to complete it. So, it's a bit difficult to recall my process.

I did spend some time looking up the best e-mail validation approach. I decided to go with regex, and then spent some time looking at various regex options. There doesn't seem to be a perfect solution for e-mail validation, so kept it failry simple.

### Continued development

I should revisit this sometime and look at whether i can make my JS and CSS more concise.
